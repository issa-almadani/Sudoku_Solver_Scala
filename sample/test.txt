Usage Note:
- input board in any format you like (with/without spaces or lines)
- the program will be able to parse the board so long as it conforms to the correct boardsize and cellvals
- whitespaces will be correctly ignored if written within bounds to be read in
- anything written beyond the boardsize limit (such as these comments) will be ignored
- the program will read only until the board is fully loaded in
